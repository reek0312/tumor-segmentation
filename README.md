# TumorTracer

The goal was to develop a binary segmentation model capable of identifying brain tumor regions in MRI scans, providing an approximate location and shape for visualization purposes, not clinical diagnosis.

## Features

1. Gives location and shape of tumor for a given brain MRI.
2. Performs 0.76 on unseen data.
3. Simple and intuitive to use.


## Usage

Two ways to use TumorTracer:

### 1. Website

[Link to Website](#) *(yet to be built)*

### 2. Model

#### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reek0312/tumor-segmentation.git
   cd tumor-segmentation

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the segmentation&visualization script in your code editor and run it as directed
