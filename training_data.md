- **Description**: This dataset consists of two folders: brain MRI images and their corresponding masks. It does not include specific labels for any particular tumor type, as it is intended solely for binary segmentation.

***P.S.*** I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and adapted/modified it for this specific use. I'm currently unable to locate the original source to properly credit it.
